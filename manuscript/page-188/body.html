It is a place which in summer appeals to the wealthy, with its luxurious hotels and gay casino, its smart world of bathing and dancing, and its expensive shops, most of them branches of the best establishments in Paris. There, in the Casino, on the <em>plage</em> or in the hotels, the <em>haut-monde</em> loves to rub shoulders with the <em>demi-monde</em>, and in these days it is, <em>par excellence</em>, the resort of the blatant war-profiteer and his fat, uncouth wife.</p><p>It was noon. The gay, cosmopolitan idlers of both sexes were either bathing or taking their <em>ap�ratif</em>, or else wandering about the scrupulously clean streets and inspecting the shops.</p><p>Sylvia, in her cream summer gown and large hat, presented a delightful figure as, at her lover’s side, she wandered presently along the Rue du Casino, in order to buy some flowers for the table of their private sitting-room at the hotel.</p></div> </div>
