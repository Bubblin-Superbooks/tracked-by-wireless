Supposed to be English. Discovered at 7.10 a.m., on October 28th, behind a small pottery factory, a mile from the village of St. Uze, close to Valence, Department of the Dr�me. The medical examination showed the person to have died from some vegetable poison. It is believed that he was deposited at the spot during the night from a passing car. No arrest has been made. Any details of identification to be sent to the Prefect of the Dr�me.”</p></blockquote></div> </div>
