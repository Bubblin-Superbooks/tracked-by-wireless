<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Next morning broke chill and misty over the Carpathians, and at half-past eleven the Baron, accompanied by Falconer, Fran�oise, and Koblitz, drove to the newly completed wireless station.</p><p>Inside the transmission hut as they stood together, the Baron took out a slip of thin paper which he carefully unfolded and handed to his companion, saying:</p><p>“The call-signal will not be found in the official book.” Then added: “As you see, the message is seven-figure code.”</p><p>Geoffrey looked and saw that the call-letters written upon the slip of paper were C.H.X.R., followed by a jumble of figures interspersed with letters of the alphabet.</p><p>The initial letter of the call showed that the station  wanted was either in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, or Roumania. No doubt it was in the latter country.</p></div> </div>
